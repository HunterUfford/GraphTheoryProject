# GraphTheoryProject

The final demo for the project is avalialbe in the /Simulation folder

You may need to download python libraries, however none should be too complicated to install using pip or conda

# Running the Demo

The main files to run in the demo are:
```
/Simulation/models/user_generator.py
/Simulation/recommender.py
/Simulation/data_analysis.py
```
You can run them like any other python script after you download their dependencies.

Example run statments:
```
cd Simulation # Navigate to Simulation folder
python models/user_generator.py
python recommender.py
python data_analysis.py
``

# /Simulation/models/user_generator.py

***This script must be run before the other two will work!***

```
networkx
random
os
json
```
This script generates user data that will appear in the /Simulation/data/users folder.



# /Simulation/recommender.py

```
random
math
json
```
This script uses the user data generated by user_generator.py to generate user recommendations for a 'root_user'

The recommendations can be viewed in consol or viewed in the /Simulation/data/recommendations/ folder

Example consol output:
```
Running BFS to explore connections...
Calculating recommendation scores...
Total recommendations found: 90
Total unique paths explored: 838
Top 10 Recommendations:
User 4: Final Score = 2.1978, Best Path Score = 0.5999, Num Paths = 38
User 28: Final Score = 0.9301, Best Path Score = 0.3525, Num Paths = 13
User 5: Final Score = 0.7976, Best Path Score = 0.3326, Num Paths = 10
User 89: Final Score = 0.7520, Best Path Score = 0.2849, Num Paths = 13
User 75: Final Score = 0.5958, Best Path Score = 0.4298, Num Paths = 3
User 50: Final Score = 0.5600, Best Path Score = 0.2878, Num Paths = 6
User 63: Final Score = 0.5506, Best Path Score = 0.1870, Num Paths = 18
User 16: Final Score = 0.5340, Best Path Score = 0.1848, Num Paths = 17
User 73: Final Score = 0.5281, Best Path Score = 0.2125, Num Paths = 11
User 19: Final Score = 0.4987, Best Path Score = 0.1760, Num Paths = 16
```

# /Simulation/data_analysis.py

```
os
json
```

This final script output some 'good-to-know' information about the user data generated in user_generator.py

Example output from this script:
```
Total users: 100
Average followers per user: 7.37
Average mutual connections per user: 4.64
User with most followers: User 4 (35 followers)
```
